Text = "Absolutely awful! I am from New Orleans, Louisiana and have eaten MANY times at HOB and have gone to HOB SIN night all my adult life. The gumbo was awful. The roux was burnt and then when I complained the waitress told me it was an acquires taste. I told her are you kidding me?? I am from NOLA and make my own roux and it is b-u-r-n-t. Period. The food was all wrong. It tasted like the chef had his training at McDonald's. That man had no business cooking Cajun food. The waitstaff was also rude and it was like pulling teeth to take the gumbo off the bill when I insisted they take it away. I live in Vegas now and I will never go to HOB again."

Text = "Wow, I can't believe someone gave Boulevard a Poor rating. I ate there recently for the second time---it was my wife's birthday, and she wanted to go to Boulevard. We were treated exceptionally well. The food was great---relatively simple, but expertly prepared and presented. My wife and I realized we had experienced too much "vertical" food of late: Fancy presentation of food oriented in tower-like fashion. But not at Boulevard. I had a steak, which was superb, and it wasn't frou-frou'ed up with some incongruous mishmash of vegetables or fried items. Desserts were quite good. The setting is somewhat clubby, but not at all cold. It's a great place to be at dusk, as the last bit of sun sets on the Bay and the Ferry Building and Bay Bridge lights begin to glow. A very memorable dining experience."

Text = "We usually go to another sushi restaurant close by but we got off to a late start and we were told Osaka stays open pretty late, well actually it says 24 hrs on the side of the building somewhere but really it stays open until 2 am. Okay, so we walk in, there seems to be a few of regulars seated at the sushi bar, quite loud and sauced I might add. We sit at the sushi bar and the first thing I notice is instead of warm washcloths we have sealed packets containing what appears to be oversized wet naps. Strike one, but whatever, it's like 11 pm at night I am hungry for sushi. it takes forever for the waitress to take our drink order. We receive our little wooden sushi geta tray with VERY pale, practically white, gari (pickled ginger) and very pale wasabi (a spicy Japanese root). This stuff looks like it sat in the sun too long and got bleached or was old. I lie to myself, thinking *maybe I am accustomed to westernized sushi with bright or pale pink gari and bright green wasabi*. "Maybe this is truly authentic" I think as I tried to justify it all. Who am I to judge, I am as Caucasian as they come. Strike two but I am still famished and I brush it off. They give us a little freebie appetizer salad, which I am accustomed to either getting edamame (soybeans) or seaweed salad, this salad consisted of a smidgen of immitation crab meat and cucumbers - cheap. Strike 3, but no out as I am starving by now. I order half an order of unagi roll (bbq eel roll), edamame (soybeans in their pods) with herb salt, and chuka salad (7 seaweed salad), oh and baked green mussels. Plus I ordered a half carafe of Pearl unfiltered sake, which I love! This is a plus. My boyfriend ordered the spider roll which is a tempura softshell crab roll. Pretty yummy usually. The people at the end of the bar are so drunk and loud it is amazing, I want to scream shut up for Buddha's sake! They were arguing with the waitress about their order saying they only had one or two beers each. They were clearly drunk. Out comes our food! The edamame was okay, what did I expect, it's soybeans. The sake was great but it is bottled sake so you have to try really hard to screw that up. The unagi roll was very thin on the eel, not really warm by the time it got to us either. The seaweed salad had more cucumbers in it than seaweed (cheap filler, I guess), the green mussels did not have QP mayo and masago on it as usual so I asked for mayo which I added, it was edible. The spider roll had barely any softshell crab in it and the crab it did have was dry, empty and surrounded my lots of batter. Plus the roll itself wasn't all that. I ate a bit of the crab out of the roll and left the rice and seaweed and accompaniments, my boyfriend ate no more after his first bite. That did it for us. Then of course more loud regulars who were quite sauced pour in and then I downed my sake and left before their loud voices gave me a headache. What a bummer this experience was because I really love sushi and I can't really afford to eat it all the time so I have to wait about another month before I can go have some real sushi. I will never go to Osaka in Henderson again. It just really was a poor experience all around. Next I will try Inaka Sushi which has all you can eat (should I even try??) - and if that doesn't work, back to my favorite restaurant - I Love Sushi in Henderson."

While waiting for the bill the manager interrogated me about sending the food back. Then, as we're sitting there still waiting on our bill, an irate Italian man starts yelling at me and then storms off. Franco's Italian Caffe is an Italian Carrow's; the food and atmosphere are equally bland. The great thing about Carrow's, however, is that it doesn't pretend to be Ruth's Chris and they don't yell at you if you send the food back!"

There are lots of healthy choices with fruits and vegetables. The desserts are small so several can be tried or shared. The main dishes are hearty and simple. This is not complicated food with fancy recipes. Just straight forward dishes that busy people might call comfort food. About three dollars more than a fast food meal and not as expensive as a menu-style restaurant. They always have helpful busspeople but not actually waitresses.

Text = "Along with several lifelong friends we traveled to Platte City on a stormy Friday night. We found not only a wonderful menu selection and wonderfully presented food, but had an experience that will keep us talking for years. We were greeted as though we were family members, and by the end of the evening we felt like we had known the owners for years. The shrimp appetizer with blue cheese was served in a blue stemmed glass in such an attractive way that I didn't want to disturb it. It was so good that I would have had it as my main course if that had been offered. Instead I had the pork loin in plum sauce. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. All of our meals were great. The service was first rate too. At the end of the evening we viewed pictures of the reconstruction of the property, and our server even sang a song for us. We passed on dessert only because we had a surprise birthday cake back home for one of our friends. But it hurt to look at the choices without getting to sample them. I'm sure we will be back."

We even returned for lunch two days later. Their signature all-you-can-eat buffet, with grilled meat and vegetables served tableside off of skewers, is pricey for dinner but reasonable for lunch. Grilled meat was ham, beef, turkey (or chicken, I forget) and vegetables. Lamb would have have been great too, but they didn't have it. Perhaps it's because the word "lamb" could have political ramifications, even though Americans really serve muton. I understand, if you want the 15% discount, you need to be an LDS missionary."

Text = "Thirty minutes after we ordered our food we had still not received the salad/bread and the server approached us to tell us there was no lasagna available and we'd have to re-order. People arriving after us and sitting in another station to our right received their salad/bread within a few minutes of ordering. We waited another half an hour at which time both of our entrees were served, however, the grilled chicken was not provided with my pasta like it was supposed to be. The server commented the cook was still preparing it and she'd bring it later. Since I had no desire to eat half the entree, I waited another ten minutes until the chicken arrived. Meanwhile, the diners in the other station were all either gone, or finsihing up their meals as we just began ours. Later, I asked to speak to the manager. A very young man arrived at our table asking what we needed. I asked if he was the manager and he replied, "no, he sent me because he's too busy". I told him I would need to speak to the manager regardless. About 10 minutes later he arrived. I shared with him the facts regarding the length of time it took to serve us and how my entree had been served in two parts. I also let him know I did not appreciate his sending out a younger employee to speak to us because he was "too busy." The man was totally unapologetic. All he would offer is that our server had more tables than others and that we needed to understand that. He also said we should be understanding that the restaurant is a small business and that he was in the kitchen helping the cook prepare food. I told him none of that should be our concern. He was very cold and no matter which way I presented the problem would not apologize or offer any type of remedy. I told him I didn't think he cared for customers much and that I didn't see any reason why we should return to the restaurant. He shrugged and said that would be okay. We were enraged at his behavior and total lack of concern for our satisfaction. He pretty much made it clear he did not care if we ever returned. It's hard to believe that would happen in this day of customer service. Just so you don't get the wrong idea, neither of us were rude to this man. To be fair, we have been to two other Strings cafes in Roseville and Fairfield and had no problems whatsover."

On a scale of 1 to 10 on how clean it is, I put it at around 4 or 5 (in other words, the health department should consider a visit). Staff: What staff? While my wife and I try to eat at a place 3 or 4 times before really forming an opinion, there have been two occasions when we sat for anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes, without even a "someone will be with your" or "have you been helped" from any of the staff. The servers clearly would rather be somewhere other than work. The managers don't appear to exist. And the food is substantially poor in quality and porportion. My wife and I have had many pleasant experiences at Red Robins across the US, but this one seems to be off in its own little world. If you are in the Woodbridge area, and want to experience what Red Robin should really be like, go to the Red Robin in Fairfax, it is on the opposite end of the scale, and one of the best."

I eat ther quite frequently, I highly recommand house special chicken with white meat, (made with breast meat opposes to dark meat."

Text = "This is how the restaurant is not worth a referral: * a tourist- made reservations- 2 weeks in advance * call to inform them we are running a few minutes late- unfamiliar with Philadelphia (they inform us it is alright and that they are running behind schedule anyway) * They say we are late- so make us wait- which is fine- but half an hour turned to over an hour * they let people go ahead of us- who had reservations an 1 hour after us * they are very rude epecially the hostess- who ignored us when approached and did not re-write our names down * when speaking to the Manager- he says the wait is not a reflection of their service * no apolgies * for waiting for over an hour- we had to pay of Valet and a coat check! We stood and waited near the doors- there wasn't even a seating area to wait. I am from Toronto, where a well-rated restaurant has a reputation because of their service. My first impression of an Italian restaurant in Philadelphia was overshadowed by such apalling conduct. I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Philadelphia especially.on Valentines! They ruined my night and had not even an apology."

Text = "Sans Souci Restaurant is a wonderful surprise. It's a NORMAL restaurant – no weird or bizarre themes, schemes, or gimmicks. Nothing that might strike you as strange on the menu either. One should dress nicely – but on the other hand, the place isn't prone to fill up with stuffed shirts or others that seem thrilled with their own self-importance. The place attracts a decent middle of the road clientele. The attentive and professional wait staff is something you would expect to find in a far more expensive operation and is rare outside of resort areas or restaurant operations that frankly are over-priced and usually a little snotty to boot. The staff is in a word "superb". The menu, while not exotic is broad - but having dined there easily in excess of 50 times let me tell you. Consider the "specials" menu. The current chef (today is March 21, 2004) is a bit of a show off and you won't be disappointed. A very talented chef indeed! The level of attention the kitchen puts into presentation is something you might expect on a first rate cruise ship or overly pricey resort. Weekends the lounge area hosts a piano player doing standards. (Nothing too loud, it's really quite nice.) Think of it! Central Connecticut – outside of Harford itself - a piano bar with no cover charge! I believe Sans Souci is alone in that claim. San Souci makes for a very pleasant evening for couples. A stop in the bar area perhaps while your table is being prepared, a leisurely dinner, fabulous desserts if you have any room left (look out for the salads on that score too, it's smart to order a "small" salad you'll see why if you don't) and then an after dinner drink or coffee back in the lounge. Their menu is big enough and their prices so reasonable that bringing the whole family and grandparents too is still affordable!"

Text = "This was one of the most bland Mexican restaurants I have ever eaten. I was lured here by the advertisement of "organic" and "no lard". When my partner and I arrived, we were interested by the appearance of the place. It's a pretty restaurant. We were eventually led to our seating - the big main room is loud and echos, like a cafeteria. Casual conversation is difficult due to the sheer noise of the place. The waitress was very helpful and friendly, but that could not offset the food. The salsas for the chips tasted like they came out of jars, and not a good brand. They were extremely mild and not a bit of spice to them. I looked around for some hot sauce and noticed that there was no salt, pepper, or hot sauce at all on any of the tables. Our food when it arrived was pretty, but incredibly dull. No flavor, very little spices, cheap ingrediants. The flan for dessert was blah and covered with butterscotch (not a carmelized sugar as it's supposed to) and sided with canned whip cream. (for $4.50 a desert, you would think they would take the 5 minutes to make a big batch of real whipped cream..it's not that hard) I looked around during dinner and then noticed something very strange - all of the people eating and all of the waitresses/waiters, were white (including myself and my partner). The only Mexican/Hispanic people in the place were doing the table cleaning. I finally figured out that to get decent food, I'd have to find where the Mexican groups ate. Tia Rosa seems to be just a factory to pump out bland/cheap food at high prices to the majority of tourists and old biddies who don't know that Mexican food is supposed to taste better than this. Not worth the $30 for dinner- I'm going back to the hole in the wall place down the street that has food that tastes 10x better for 1/4 the price."

I am sorry to say but this is truly a place for tourists only because once you have tried it, you will not go back again. The only attractive of the restaurant is it names because if you are a garlic lover like me, you think you will be satisfied with the intensive smell and the favor of the garlic. We ordered their famous Garlic chicken, Garlic mussels and a pizza. Let me tell you, you will be truthly disappointed because the favor of the food is very bland. The presentation is not spectacular.

Ask to sit on the outside deck, high above the street with a view down the valley and enjoy a glass from their well stocked wine list. The broad menu has both traditional and non-traditional Italian dishes each made with their own unique twist. The clear local favorite when I have been there is a very powerful Balsamic Chicken. Be warned: the waitress asked each table if they had tried their version of it before she would accept the order. All portions are large enough to insure part can be taken home. The separate cigar area is very effectively removed from the non-smoking area. A variety of entertainment is scheduled on Friday and Saturday evenings. Valet parking is provided."

It's like no one there has eaten in a week, it is the most disgusting display of gluttony and so crowded and loud playing bizarre pop music. People eat here with such poor manners that food flew through the air and got caught in my hair more than once from people NOT at my table. It's too crowded. The hot food, while ample, tasted old. The sushi did not taste fresh, which is a scary thing regarding sushi. The lines for food were impossibly long. They refilled drinks readily and cleared plates often and that was really the only redeeming thing I have to say about the restaurant. And the location? Sucks. You have to deal with all the movie traffic and the freeway offramp. It's always cold in Daly City and their lobby cannot accomodate the line, which runs out the door; so bring a jacket with your barf bag."

The atmosphere was as Italian as the area has to offer and is upscale enough that you can feel comfortable in suit and tie or down to earth enough to wear blue jeans and sweatshirt. Victoria's is small enough for intimate dinners for two but large enough for large Italian family dinners. Victoria's has a full bar, excellent service, exquisite food, and delightful atmosphere.

Text = "Three years ago, my wife and I watched a show on the Food network in which chef Anthony Bourdain travelled around the world in search of interesting and fantastic cuisine. In one episode, he landed in the kitchen of legendary chef Thomas Keller's The French Laundry, and he lauded the restaurant and Keller as culinary deities. Each of the 14 courses that were brought out had Bourdain physically emoting with pleasure and reverence. In the years since, my wife has hassled me about going to Napa to eat at this place. When we finally got around to planning a trip to wine country, I was determined to get reservation to The French Laundry, no matter what. Exactly two months prior to the date we would be in Yountville, I called at exactly 10 AM, and, for 45 minutes, continuously pressed redial on 4 seperate phone lines until I got through to the reservation line. Amazingly, I was able to secure a lunch reservation for two on July 3rd, 2004. When I called my wife at work, she screamed in disbelief, and I soaked up the luxuries of my good fortune. When we arrived at the restaurant, it was literally like a dream come true. Our server was extremely professional and she knew every detail about every dish and bottle. Course by course, fanciful dishes were brought to our table in unhastened, tightly-controlled flourishes. At some points throughout the tasting there would be no less than five servers lurking around our table with multiple components to the dishes laid out before us. At or around the ninth course, my wife became ill because she was so stuffed and so we strolled out into the garden to get some fresh air. While we sat on a bench nestled in ivy and honeysuckle, we peered through the window into the kitchen, where Thomas Keller stood hunched over a dish, delicately manipulating our next course for presentation. I could not believe where I was, what I was witnessing. We returned to our table and my wife (108 lbs) just nibbled from then on, and I (250 lbs) happily lapped up both her dishes and mine. After three hours and 11 courses, additional sweets and courses continued to pour out of the kitchen, totalling around 14 courses. Finally, we received our bill and I happily paid the small sum of $680 for the two tastings, two bottles of medium-priced but excellent wine, plus tip. Yes, it was the most expensive lunch I've ever had and pardon me for being so gauche by admitting how much I paid, but let me tell you it was WORTH IT. I have never tasted food this amazing before, and the voyeuristic moments I spent in the garden watching Keller work was one of the highlights of my life. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who appreciates complex and perfectly-prepared cuisine- but remember this tip- use at least four phone lines exactly two months prior and press redial on every one and don't give up- you deserve to treat yourself once in a while no matter the cost."

The bistro menu changes seasonally and features full bar service and an exceptional wine list with more than 100 excellent wines from around the world, including several offered by the glass. If you drink red, try a bottle of the Shooting Star Syrah for an exceptional accompaniment to your meal. The restaurant's menu features elegant dishes cooked with a delicate hand. Flavors are blended with subtlety, and to perfection. Appetizers are stylish beginnings to the Asian- and French-inspired entrees. The Maryland Crabcake is chock-full of crab combined with breadcrumb and subtle spices drizzled with mouth-watering wasabi vinaigrette. (I have pleaded with the chef for his recipe, but he hasn't divulged the secret… yet!) The Prince Edward Island Mussels are gently steamed in a spicy Thai coconut broth with just a hint of cilantro. Entrees include Seared Sesame Tuna served rare under a soy-ginger vinaigrette over jasmine rice accompanied by wasabi and pickled ginger. (Delicious!) As you can see I am a big fan of fish dishes but there are plenty of other options including Gramercy Paella – a satisfying, saffron-spiced Bahai rice, slow-cooked with fresh mussels, hot sausage, shrimp, chicken, crawdads and green peas. Filet mignon is stuffed with rich blue cheese in the colder months, and in springtime Petit Filet Mignon is served with Bordelaise sauce and mushroom duxelle. Service is swift and friendly. Water glasses, as well as the all-important wine glass, are filled regularly. Dinner accompanied by a good bottle of wine is a very reasonable $30 per person (not including gratuity.) For a leisurely Sunday morning gourmet experience, Gramercy's brunch favorites include Mexican French Toast, a French-battered tortilla with fresh fruit and Kahlua syrup, and Cinnamon Roll French Toast made with rounded, cinnamon bread – thinly sliced and lightly battered. If you're feeling frisky, try the ‘Good Morning Cosmo' featuring sparkling wine, cranberry juice, Cointreau and fresh lime juice. In the 1990s, chef-owner Alexander ‘Sandy' Smith owned and operated several Northern Berkshire favorites including Cobble Cafe, Mezze and Wild Amber Grill before starting Gramercy Bistro in 2001. I have been following him ever since I tried his food at Cobble Cafe and will keep doing so until he tells me to stop… I highly recommend this destination for anyone who takes food seriously!"

Friends have eaten here and enjoyed it, but I will never attempt it again. I had prime rib and it was cold and really fatty. The baked potato was not done completely and the service was slow on requests. They did redo the prime rib and it came back even worse. If you eat here I recommend just getting the salad bar, which is good!"

The appetizers were also tasty, especially the coconut shrimp. The bananas foster for dessert was to die for! The only thing I didn't like was the fact that I had 3 starches on my plate, mashed potatoes, corn, and rice. I would have much rather had rice or potatoes and a green vegetable. Other than that, everything was excellent."

Text = "This was perhaps the worst $40 I've ever spent on food and soda for my Wife and I. We went when they just opened on a weekend. Parking was no problem in the garage. I wish there was no space to park so I would have gone elsewhere. Their "hot" foods were warm. Tables were tiny. What's this wonderful service I keep on reading about. We sure didn't experience it when we were there. Empty soda glasses waiting to be refilled sat on on the small table along with our empty dirty dishes. It took several minutes before I could flag someone down to check out. It looks like you can't just get up and pay as you exit. Maybe I'm wrong. The tables are too close together. Kids were running around. If you can't watch your kids while you're at a restaurant, maybe it's a sign you should leave them home with a babysitter. Poor value. Warm food being passed off as hot. Fried foods were overcooked and had no flavor. The only highlight was dessert and parking. I wish I had my $40 back. Their website doesn't even let you express your dissatisfaction. The only way my Wife and I will return is if someone invited us to go with them and they were picking up the tab. Stay away!!! At least we didn't get sick from this place. Aaaaaaahhh!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"

Text = "Every Sunday, the Anzu restaurant located inside the Hotel Nikko, features a Sunday Brunch, hosted by local Bay Area jazz radio station, KKSF 103.7, which broadcasts live from the brunch on Sundays . The menu varies from week to week, however the quality of the food and the level of service never varies. I usually make my reservations for this fabulous brunch experience via Opentable.com, and even on an occasion when I was more than half an hour late, the hostess was still kind enough to seat myself and my party promptly, (I called to advise the restaurant I was running late, highly recommended). This Sunday Brunch is one of my personal favorites when visiting San Francisco, the food is plentiful, fresh, and just plain good eating. What is served is "fusion" Japanese Cuisine, yes there is plenty of Sushi , but for the "I'm not so sure I want raw fish" person, there is also your standard American brunch fare, omelets cooked to order, waffles, sausage, bacon, salmon, fresh breads, fresh fruit, beautifully creative salads, Beef Wellington, and not mention the incredible desserts, did I mention the Sunday Brunch is buffet style ("all you can eat")? I personally believe that the Sunday brunch at the Hotel Nikko is one of the best in the city; If I may make a suggestion, the next time you're in the City of San Francisco and you want to impress your friends or family with an excellent meal and above average service, make reservations at Anzu. Please don't limit yourself by just having a meal at the Sunday brunch, but try the out the restaurant any day of the week. Even though, Hotel Nikko is a Japanese-style hotel, Anzu boasts top quality prime aged beef from Chicago as part of its regular menu."

Having ordered Kung Pao in many restaurants world wide, I have never been served "sauteed chicken and vegetables"; the indifferent waitress insisted that this dish was Kung Pao. Small portions, no flavor, dismal wait staff. There are many other restaurants in Chinatown worthy of your time."

Text = "When I was in San Jose, recently, I ate at an excellent restaurant – The Grill. My family and I started with an appetizer of fried calamari. They were fried to perfection, larger than usual, but very tender. The red sauce that accompanied it was good too. The calamari was totally great. For dinner I had a 24 oz. Rib-eye steak. I ordered the steak to be cooked medium. It was cooked just right! The meat was juicy, tasty, and yummy. It was so good, I ate almost the entire piece of meat, leaving very little on the bone. My family also shared a platter of onion rings and french fries. The onion rings were very thin, like shoestrings potatoes, and fried to a golden brown color. They were sweet and mighty tasty! For dessert I had double chocolate ice cream. The ice cream was more like a chocolate mousse. My brother had French vanilla ice cream which was more like regular ice cream. Together it made a rich and creamy ending to my meal. As for the service it was what you would expect from a fine restaurant like The Grill. The 2 waiters (the 2 Brians) were kind and knew everything. Nothing was impossible. Chris (the maitre de) came over and made sure everything was fine. He was so nice to us. I really liked him. I really liked The Grill. I rate this restaurant 4 1/4 stars out of 5. Caroline R, Age 11"

Text = "The birthday party was intended to be a pleasant experience.....not an event in which our party felt like we should squeegie windows in order to eat there. The party started off with a rude confirmation on the reservation. The hostess was rude and was not hospitable to our requests. I do not understand why we should be required to order a 35 dollar set menu for our party when we made it clear that some of our party were only joining us so a drink. They finally agreed to let us order a la carte. We started off with some satays.....we should have started off with our bill. The satays had as much meat on them as you whould get from one McDonalds french fry. The remaining appetizers were ok..just stay away from the crab and scallop starter. For fourteen dollars you would expect a hell of alot more than the 2 oz of crab and the 2 mini scallops that we got. Our entrees were over done and my Venison came with a potato hash that more resembled McCain Fries. The entrees were not creative and I felt like I was on an airplane when I received them. What a rip off!! Happy birthday to my friend? More like happy birthday to Glowbal who got the best present of the evening...OUR MONEY!!!!"

Text = "House of Prime Rib (1906 Van Ness Avenue) is a meat lover's fancy feast--especially if you have a hunger for something really good and filling, located in a respectable setting with a courteous waitstaff. A superb place where the well prepared Prime Rib is wheeled to your table, sliced and served right onto your plate. It is soooo good and perfect, I remember that I didn't need to use a knife to cut my portion. If you are going to taste a Prime Rib in San Francisco, this is the place. Even for its price and value ($22-29), including the fixings (Creamed Spinach and Garlic Mashed Potatoes), and even an extra serving, free of chare upon your request--it's unbeatable!!!"

Text = "The Little pink cards scattered throughout the cafe welcomes you and give you ordering instructions, part of the process involves raising your hand when your name is called. They also recommend tripping the server to get their attention; I personally don't think that is a good idea, simply because you would probably miss some of the world's best clam chowder as you are being escorted from the building. They Claim to sell more clam chowder than any other restaurant on the west coast, last year alone the Splash Cafe Owners Joanne and Ross Currie prepared over 10,000 gallons of the creamy sauce. When I passed through the city of Pismo Beach, which is located just about midway between Los Angeles and San Francisco, I noticed a line of customers wrapping around the block, and while I personally hate lines, I had to see what the all the fuss was. To my suprise and enjoyment It turned out to be the best stop I ever made! So good I took a fresh frozen pint home with me! I am going to say the Splash Cafe makes the "BEST CLAM CHOWDER" I have ever had and I have had plenty. I am a Clam Chowder addict and I just found my new fix! The Splash Cafe has a great presentation when you order the sourdough bread bowl. I don't want to give away their secret, I suggest you swing by Pismo Beach (a great tourist spot) and check out the Splash Cafe! Hey Joanne and Ross could you send me some more of your chowder!!!! I heard you are opening one in San Luis Obispo, I want an invite to the grand opening! CEO Of We8there.com"

We were ignored for 15 minutes till we finally decided against spending our money where we were unwanted. On our way out the host apologized with a lame. "oh Sorry." But there was no management intervention or attempt to save our business. The food smelled good and it appeared to be a delightful destination to sit and enjoy cocktails etc. Unfortunately for us the staff just couldn't be bothered with offering us beverages or anything for that matter so we left and will never go back. There are too many good restaurants like Kincaids down there where they do give good service."

Text = "Waxing nostalgic for the lunches you ate in your high school cafeteria? Then make your way to Stacey's Buffet, where steam tables laden with salty food, either under or overcooked, comprise the bulk of your dining experience. Any sauce that may have been added to a chicken and rice dish had evaporated; it was dry and tasteless. A leathery patty of dubious quality meat posed as a "steak." Ribs had an undefinable and unpleasant taste we learned was paprika, added because the chef had run out of the appropriate spices. Vergetables are either canned or frozen. The salad bar consisted of wilted lettuce and a variety of accompaniments that looked far from fresh and very unappealing. A wide selection of desserts were overly sweet. Only the dinner rolls merit a positive comment, but man cannot dine on bread alone. The low prices attract a crowd of mostly seniors who obviously are indifferent to what they eat. This is definitely a place to avoid."

We attempted to order wine, three of which they were out of so continues with just a few cocktails. We tried the satays which were written up in one of the local papers and were surprised by the lack of content on the plate. We also tried the carpaccio which was a much better value. The entrees were average with not much on the plates to match the descriptions that were on the menu. My salmon was med. well instead of the med. rare that I would have perferred. My husbands Pork chop was good though as was the Tuna. The creme brulee was very good but our overall experience was soured by the lack of personality from our waitress. She was a little to stuffy for the room and seemed like she was in a hurry to get us out. Well it worked as we did not order anything else. Glowbal has a great room but needs to work on the rest to do their reputation justice."

The room is painted in an unusually ugly colour scheme which keeps your focus. Never mind. How's the food ? The starter was a boring slice of smoked salmon with no effort at all to even enhance it's presentation. The rib-eye beef reminded me of 25 years ago eating cardboard flavoured army stew from a tin can. Dessert was white. I am not sure what it was, just to say it was white. The prices were exorbitant and the atmosphere was pallid. The waitress even chased our party down the street afterwards to correct a minor error on the bill. I actually cannot say anything good about this place. Incredibly they had the audactity to put framed quotes and comments from positive newspaper reviews in the toilets. They must have been very selective choosing words carefully for highlighting. Sorry Fado. How you are in business is hard to fathom. I won't be back."
