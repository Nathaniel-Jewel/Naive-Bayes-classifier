Pretties view of Destin Harbor. If you are only going for drinks. Shrimp Creole used frozen mini salad shrimp. Not acceptable in a town known for its fresh seafood.

Found hair twice in my entree. management was unresponsive to my concern and made no attempt to remedy the incident. In fact, upon lodging my complaint, the manager "short-changed" me when I paid the check!!

Food was way too overpriced for the quality of food. The portions were small, and the food really lacked a lot of flavor. The atmoshpere is okay, but I would never eat there again. Oh, parking is also sparse.

This dining experience fell quite short of it`s expectations. Portions were very small. The cuban bean soup tasted like the canned lentil soup I ate as a child. Minus the chopped hot dogs.And what the hell was I thinking when I ordered an inside out ravioli...Noone was happy with their meal.........Should have gone to painters for the for the blackened steak salad and Shrimp rocco.

Ever since Il Sole re-opened I have been dying to go in and for what I thought relive the experience of true Italian dining again. We were so disappointed to see what Il Sole has become ever since they opened . Not only is the food not even good but no one even recognized us. Il Sole has lost it's charm and things just don't feel the same. It's a true shame ............

We posted a review of the Shady Maple Smorgasbord back in November of 2003 and gave our honest opinion as to the quality of their establishment.We stand by our opinion that not only was the food bland,but that most of it was not even freshly prepared and was of a mass-produced,pre-packaged nature.We have been visiting Pennsylvania and the Pennsylvania Dutch region annually for the last 11 years,and despite what the previous reviewer has to say,we do appreciate the cooking styles unique to the region.We expect freshly-prepared dishes lightly seasoned so that one tastes the true flavors of the ingredients,not just the spices.We do not,however,expect a true Pennsylvania Dutch restaurant to serve food that would be more suitable for the Hometown Buffet.Both my maternal and paternal grandmothers were excellent cooks in their own ways,but if one of them had prepared food of the type served at the Shady Maple Smorgasbord I would have wondered which industrial kitchen she was employed at!We are not saying that the food here was disgusting,just not what we expected after all that we had heard over the years.We are just stating our opinion that,of the dozens of restaurants that we have dined at in the region over the past 11 years,the Shady Maple Smorgasbord was the most disappointing. This is a forum where we are all free to give voice to our opinions on any given restaurant.We have no problem if someone disagrees with our opinion and wants to post their own conflicting review.Please,however,do not call into question our knowledge of various styles of cuisine.We take great effort to be fair in our opinions.Sometimes we are probably too lenient.Thank you.

Run-of-the-mill American restaurant; Americana decor, pub-like ambiance with black and white checkered tablecloths. We were started with Sourdough bread and whipped butter  sad to say this was the highlight of our experience. Everything went downhill from here. For appetizers we were intrigued by the Buffalo Shrimp ($7.99). What a waste of seafood! For entrees, I had the Hawaiian Chicken and Shrimp Salad with Coconut Mango Dressing ($10.99). The dressing- the coconut overpowered the mango; the pineapple was clearly out of a can and the chicken strips from the Perdue package or the deli section of the grocery. The greens were even worse! Not one ingredient in this salad was fresh! Hubby had a Bacon Cheddar burger ($6.99) it was decent, charbroiled (can't go wrong with that) and a nice size. Big disappointment in general, though no surprise. Other items that sounded appetizing: the Kalamata Pesto Bruschetta ($6.99). I guess we'll never find out if this is good or not.

Tonno Rosso has a beautiful view of the bay, but that's where the good part ends. Prices are high for ho-hum appetizers and bland fish. Side dishes were over-salted but lacking any other flavor.

Let me make it very simple. In a restaurant the most important food is the french fries or hash browns. This is because with almost every dish you will be getting a side order of either french fries or mashed potaoes. I can go into how bad their other dishes are including their mashed potatoes but lets stick to something simple like french fries. French fries need to be well cooked on the inside and crispy on the outside. At beadles neither is done. I cook better fries and I'm only a commercial truck driver. If you have a cook that cannot cook french fries then it's time to get an entirely different cook and I don't mean his brother either.

One should be wary of all-you-can-eat experiences offered at bargain prices. Clearly, if a restaurant is offering too much for too little, in order to show a profit, something needs to be sacrificed - and usually it's the quality of the food. There are a bountiful number of choices here, a few of them actually edible, but for the most part the cuisine borders on the disastrous. You can't go wrong if you stick to the salad bar, where everything is fresh. It's the hot buffet selections that are the kitchen's downfall. Salt appears to be the only seasoning in use here, and there's far too much of it in everything. The pink meat warned us that the roast chicken was dangerously undercooked, whereas the bourbon chicken was burnt and tough. Meatloaf contained more bread filler than it did meat. The pot roast was fatty, overdone, too dry, and tasteless. French fries were perfect, but mashed potatoes needed to be doctored quite a bit. Pizza was underbaked, leaving the dough white and chewy. Television ads promise steaks 1" thick, but you didn't need a ruler to see this claim is way off the mark. Steaks are precooked, then thrown on the grill to heat up, making rare impossible and medium rare unlikely. The fried onions offered with them were done well, but the mushrooms tasted boiled rather than sauteed. Soups were weak and flavorless. Desserts are plentiful and, for the most part, very good - just avoid the soft serve "ice cream," which had a peculiar texture and taste. A nearby server was attentive to all her tables, but we had to request clean plates and drink refills several times before ours responded. The noise level is very high at peak dining times, and negotiating your way between tables and through the various food lines can be treacherous in a crowd. We had been here once before for Sunday brunch and had returned based on how pleased we had been with our meal, but obviously they do eggs far better than anything more ambitious. This is clearly a place popular with families and senior citizens on fixed incomes, but those who are seeking a decent meal and can afford higher prices definitely are advised to eat elsewhere.

One word - E X P E N S I V E ! ! ! ! ! Where did this Denny's come from?? We do Denny's in the U.S. all the time but never have we been gouged like this. We ordered breakfast - 3 grand slams with coffee and the bill after tax (before tip - a mismomer - WE DIDNT LEAVE ONE THE SERVICE WAS SO PATHETIC) was $42. Yes that's a 4 followed by a 2 in Canadian dollars about $30 US. We'll NEVER go to this or any Denny's in the Niagara area EVER AGAIN!!! We also checked out another one near the Hilton Hotel - which we were told was owned by the Hilton - and it was exactly the same expensive menu. For those prices, we'll eat AT the Hilton. There was another Denny's on Lundy's Lane but after seeing the other two, we wouldn't waste our time checking it out. Oh, almost forgot - the food was HORRID! Eggs were not as ordered and we were told the cook couldn't do it the way we asked?? Excuse me?? What kind of a cook can't poach an egg for crying out loud? We were politely TOLD to take it or leave it unless we wanted to reorder and pay for it as well. That was the last straw and we ate and ran, probably what they wanted us to do anyway.

It is not the food quality that Sunset Restaurant need to improve. They need to develop better people skills.

We live here and have only eaten here when out of town guests demand to go. It's a true tourist trap. Stone crabs were like rubber...mustard sauce is flavorless. Key Lime pie is good. Service was rushed and rude. Save time and money and go to Publix (local grocery) and get 5 lbs of Stone Crabs for 1/10th of the price and a pint of mustard sauce. Get their Key Lime Pie and you'll and eat at home or on a blanket on the beach. FAR cheaper and more enjoyable experience.

This place shouldn't be called the No Name bar and Grill, it should be called the No Service Bar & Grill. I was working away from my office the other day and thought I'd try this place on the square in Tyler since I was is the area. Needless to say it was a mistake. I walk in, order, and 35 MINUTES later get a burger that was ok at best. I only saw my waiter once the entire time and at one point he LEFT THE PLACE. So, while I know you can't expect the best from a cheap little place like this, there's no excuse for terrible service. Hope you don't make the same mistake I did.

We reserved their main table in the window for our anniversary. When we got there they said that was reserved by someone else and sat us in the back. The rear seating has all the atmosphere of a high school cafeteria. There were only 3 other couples and it became clear to us, that they had given the front table we requested to friends of theirs. The food was second rate. The seabass I ordered had been steamed beyond recognition. When my wife ordered a glass of wine, the glass itself was filthy. To top off a perfect evening, my credit card was stolen from my jacket, which was inside their locked cloakroom. I would never go to Pallucci's again nor would I ever reccomend it to anyone I liked.

negative positive
Lamottes was the absolute worst experience I have ever had. We had reservations, and we had to wait for a table because they seated people without reservations. The food was terrible, the service was terrible and I would not recomend this place to anyone. The atmosphere is quite humiliating. The tables are in horrible condition and look like they were hand made by an employee. The service was horrible. The bus kids did more for us than our waitress. The silverware was dirty as well as some of our drinking glasses. I would rate this restaurant a 0 if it was an option. Do not go to this restaurant if you are looking for a pleasant dining experience.

SERVICE at Latorres: We were in Latorres restaurant the night of Dec 13 and were very impressed by the service that provided to a couple seated close to us. They were provided a special appetizer, attentive but discrete service. Their courses were spaced wonderfully; allowing them to enjoy their meal and your atmosphere. Their water was filled as necessary, and their plates were cleared after they had finished the course and had time to clear their palate for the next serving. That particular couple were seated when we arrived. When we left, they were just being served their main dish. They were clearly being offered service that reflected their desire to enjoy the evening at your establishment. How do we get such service? We were rushed from the moment we arrived. We were hurried to place our orders quickly. Our plates were taken before we finished our course. We treated with utmost disrespect, as if we were a burden upon you. Our courses were brought to us before our previous course was complete, and they were not even warm. To add insult to this injury, the Maitre D' constantly interrupted us to take chairs from our table to suit her needs. (We noticed that she didn't bother the "special" guests to whom we refer above.) We went out to have a pleasant, leisurely evening. They know how to offer that (you did for the other couple). Instead, we had a horrible experience. They got our money. And our lasting memory of an awful evening.

Probably one of my most unusual and unpleasant lunch experiences. We ordered iced tea for drinks and they were served in very small highball type glasses with more ice than tea. So during the course of the meal we had to ask for more tea. I should have known something was up when we got new glasses each time. When the bill came our iced tea chargel alone was $7.50. We were charged $1.50 for each glass of tea. When I asked the waitress about the unreasonable drink bill, she informed us that there are no refills on drinks. I asked why she had not informed us of that and here curt response was "It's in the menu"! I asked to see the menu and yes it did say that, but in very small print well below the drink section of the menu. I put the bill on my charge and did not leave a tip. When we were just outside the front door, this waitress charged out and wanted to know where her tip was. I told her that the bartender had it in the form of an outrageous drink bill. She then went back inside and slammed the door. I was not going to say anything about the bill, but after that experience I sought out the owner. He explained the drink policy, but just blew me off about the conduct of the waitress. Needless to say on subsequent visits to beautiful Door County, we have avoided this unfriendly place.

This a cold, sterile-like restaurant with extremely poor service. Drinks are $9.00 each. Food is less than average. The restaurant is generally quite empty; therefore we thought we would receive good service...we didn't. Stay away!!!

The food was fair but portions were small. I actually have similar comments about the manager Steve. We had 3 toddlers at the table. One of the toddlers took the napkin off the other table. the manager , Steve, kept on coming by with dirty looks. I offered to pay for the 3 paper napkins but he said that children should never act that way. It is definately not a child friendly place. It was a very poor experience

Well where do I began, We went at night and the young lady (rang us up) and young man(who sat us) we very nice and I know have been there for years. There was a young lady with long blonde hair that was there for quite some time that was the reason we went there so often but for some reason is not there any more so we only go once in awhile. I know alot of people who dont go there any more because shes not there, but anyway the food and other staff members are not what it used to be and if you go there be forwarned you are taking your chances, but you never know it may be a good day there and you wont get moldy or spoiled food. GOOD LUCK

My wife and I had reservations. It took over an hour to be seated. We were told the grill would be closed shortly after we were seated. My wife's food seemed rushed. Mine was so salty that the manager almost fell over when I insisted he taste it. We left the restaurant angry and disgusted. Unless you are a know food critic or a cherished regular don't expect to be treated respectfully.

I would say that anyone might want to go once...the Rainforest "theme" is fun the first time (stupidly, this was not our first time). After arriving at 7pm, we were STILL waiting to be seated at 9:30pm and didn't see a crumb of food until almost 10:30pm. Overpriced, mediocre-tasting food and the longest wait ever for the privilege of it all. The "theme" wasn't enough to get me to overlook everything else.

After reading all the glowing reviews, I couldn't wait to try this landmark of the Sunset! Well, after my experience, I decided it's perfect for those who don't like sushi, meaning raw fish. Every roll was drenched in mayonnaise,and my order of Amaebi was shrimp previously frozen...I also had the annoying feeling of waitstaff hovering over me to leave after 20 minutes.

I think Angelina's is the closest to home cooking out of any Italian restaurant I've ever been to. Although the service is not up to par, the food overshadows it. You kind of feel like you are in Grandma's living room and the food really makes it feel that way!

I had a very shocking and surprising experience. The customer service is not at all good. So, we decided not to give any tips. At the end, they demanded tips and we told the reasons why we are not giving. So, the guy asked us not to come again. What kind of Restaurant is this ? This is my first ever experience in my life. I hope this may be last experience also.

The 80 items this restaurant claims to have on its all-you-can-eat buffet is a gross exaggeration, but to say that the twenty or so dishes on display when we were there were inedible is not. Initially, we thought we were the only patrons at the height of the lunch hour due to its location - nearly at the end of a strip mall (set well back and out of view from the main drag), where the primary draw is a discount dollar store. We quickly discovered that we were probably the only ones there because everyone else who had tried it knew not to return and had warned everyone they could to stay away. Nothing looked fresh, and everything tasted like reheated leftovers from the previous day. How else to explain the stir fry dishes with vegetables the consistency of mush? The soups were thin and tasteless. Pot stickers were dry and rubbery. A pork roast that looked fatty and undercooked inexplicably lay in a pan of greasy water instead of on a carving board. Most of the selections were lukewarm at best. We avoided the seafood and sushi, suspecting the worst. Dessert included stale cream puffs and ice cream coated with freezer burn, further suggesting that few people had eaten there in recent times. Our negative comments to the owner as we paid the check were met by a blank stare. To add insult to injury, all of us suffered severe intestinal distress within an hour after leaving, despite the fact none of us finished eating any one of the items we had selected. Avoid this one like the plague!

Worst restaurant I've been to in my 30+ years..The Puritan in manchester, NH is by far the worst I've visited. I visited their online site and found their prices to be a little higher than the other restaurants in the area like the 99 and such. Unfortunately you don't get what you pay for. Puritan does not allow reservations on Fridays and will only allow reservations for 5 or more during the other weeks days, so much for a romantic evening with a loved one. But I thought, hey the place is always packed and must be worth the wait. Unfortunatley the wait was quite long as the waiting room was always full on Fridays. I decided to try take-out instead. I ordered a clam roll and a "bison" burger. On the menu is says the Clam roll(9.95) comes with a kosher and fries. We received the clam roll, maybe 6 clams on the bread, the kosher dried out and a small bag of potato chips, interesting. The "bison" burger is not the only burger on the menu as they list a texas burger with the same toppings added. The "bison" burger is 5.95, a dollar more than the texan burger with the same toppings. One would assume that the bison burger is bigger than the texan because of the additional cost, so I ordered the "bison" burger assuming I'd get a big burger. Additionally the burgers come with lettuce,tomato,onion and mayo, plus the usual kosher and fries. I also ordered the extra toppings of bacon and cheese, an extra $1.20. Total burger cost was 7.15 before tax. What I received was not what I had ordered. I got a burger bun, a small black patty the size of a mcdonalds hamburger with a see through slice of cheese, fries smaller than a mcdonalds small fry and a dried out kosher. You'll take note I did not mention I received any toppings besides the cheese. Besides that, both meals were very cold 20 minutes after ordering as it was sitting in a stack of other take-out meals against a wall near the icecream bin. I tried to eat the burger, but had to rip it in half with both hands to get to the softer dried out parts. I gave up and through it out.

The place was filthy. The food was undercooked and rotten. Only when the servers were done picking at food and talking did they decide to served us. You could hear people swearing and yelling from the kitchen. Not a place I would recommend to anyone who would like a nice evening out.

Ultimately, I was very disappointed after reading the other reviews on this site. Basically, our server's attitude can at best be described as indifferent. The pasta special was ourageously priced (more than 2 times most of the other pasta dishes) which was a suprise we only learned about only after getting the bill. On the positive side, the wall of candles was nice as was the fresh bread. In the end, I doubt we will return here again.

negative positive
we had reservations for 9:00pm. at 10pm, we were still not seated because the resturant has over booked and didin't feel that we should be warned about it. they didn't even offer us a glass of water in the meantime, and suggested we go to another bar to wait. these people should not be in the hospitality business! they suck!

Ordered the rack of lamb. Truly the best we have ever had. It has become the gold standard for ever more. The salad was as good as it gets as were the desserts. A marvelous experience. Highly recommended. A++++ P.S. Do yourself a BIG favor: ignore Mr. Dowell's review. He's a complainer and a crank.

My wife & I ordered Argentinean strip & tenderloin steaks. They were superb, tasty & tender. House margarita is great. Complimentary tortilla chips and salsa is served at beginning. Salsa is served in a single skimpy plate. Ask waiter to bring one for every person in your party so you don't have to reach across table and drip all over. Hand waiter your parking ticket when asking for check, and the fee will be deducted from your bill.

Sweatman's is the mecca of South Carolina barbeque. Saying it is the best barbeque s an understatement. If you make the trip and can find this place you will eat the best pulled barbeque and by far the best hash and rice you will ever eat in your entire life and maybe your next life. The atmosphere only adds to the flavor of the food. It is an old house in the middle of the country that is only open on the weekend. They cook the pigs right out back starting the night before which anyone who knows is how long you need to cook good barbeque, all night and very, very slowly. If you like barbeque or if you hate it, you will never have any better period. This is the place in the state that all the good barbeque cooks learned the trade and secrets of good ole' lowcountry barbeque and hash. If you are driving to Charleston or anywhere near there, take the holly hill exit off of I-26 and head to eutawville and ask someone how to get there, I promise you will not be disapointed. Only open on Friday & Saturday.

On a quiet sidestreet, you'll find Gasparito, located in a traditional Cunucu house. Serving traditional Aruban fare, the food was perfect in both presentation and taste. Each meal is served with a side of Aruban vegetables. Although Gasparito was packed, the service was not too slow or too fast - no one rushes in Aruba.

Frankie's is a GREAT Italian Bistro! Specialities include: pasta dishes, wood fired pizzas, and classic veal entrees. The marinara sauce and handmade meatballs are fabulous! You can taste fresh herbs and garlic throughout. Portions are generous and most entrees can easily be split. BONUS-- great wine list with 58 bottles $30 or less. They now take reservations--which are STRONGLY suggested Thurs-Sun evenings. Mangia!

This is a truly fun place to eat and hangout. Sits right on Chesapeake Bay and the fishing boats pull right up to the restaurant. They also have an outstanding wine shop and deli. Food in the restaurant is some of the best seafood around but very reasonably priced. I could eathere almost every night.

The absolutely Best meal and restaurant experience that anyone can have. From the moment you enter till the second you leave, every detail is taken care of. Truly a magnificent way to spend a few hours. The selection of steaks, fresh fish and seafood was perfect. Dinning in the wine cellar also only further adds to the experience.

Best food cook to order, best prices. Frehness outstanding. Staff always pleasent, thoughtfull. Serving size is fantastic. You will miss alot if you don't go. They also have freh made ice cream and even a cone where you can get both vanilla & Choc. on one cone. Just a suggestion order a small cone thier large is to big for even 2 people.

It was a very pleasantful experience. I enjoyed the setting, which felt nice and cozy. I felt almost like I was sitting at home. The service was great. They explained how it might take a little longer than most places to get my food, because everything was made fresh to order, which I didn't mind waiting for if it was being made fresh. I don't think anyone would mind waiting a little longer for food if it's fresh. Their mocha's, I think, are better than any place that I've been before. Better than Starbucks. I really enjoyed myself while I was there, and I'm definately going to return next week.

Barbara Jean's is well known in St. Simons.Their sign says it all-"Southern Cuisine".Not hard to find,just look for the people waiting for a table on the main street (all of two blocks long).Red beans and rice,sweet jalepeno cornbread-it's all good.For desert,just ask for "chocolate stuff"-it has no name,that's what they call it.We also recommend the 4th Of May Cafe about a block up from Barbara Jean's-the blackened catfish was great ! The Red Barn up the road a bit specializes in massive steaks and great cheesecake.There is also a Barbara Jean's in Ponte Vedre ,Fl and they have a website.

Cactus Willies is a great buffet restaurant food usually good and hot and the price is right. The only problem that I notice is you need a server to get your drinks, a lot of the time it is hard to get the servers attention for a refill because the servers are off in a corner talking to each other. Management needs to do something about this problem.

1. My experience at Sydnee DeMar was a pleasure! The food was delicious! It was served with style, flair and efficiency! The pasta and shrimp were my favorites along with the YaYa a.k.a seafood gumbo ! Watch out for the jerk wings ! Did I mention the leftovers? The entrees are well proportioned.... and are tasty treat when hunger strikes...again! This is a new restaurant we found near the Inner Harbor in Baltimore and it has been described as 'intimate, upscale and delicious!' Indeed so! The service was good ~ and the Manager greeted us at our table to ensure everything was prompt and in order. When you visit Sydnee DeMar you won't leave hungry and you'll have change too! Review submitted by: Angela Singletary 2. Sydnee Demar is one of the best places I have been to in a while. The food was excellent & affordable. The interior design is what impress me the most along with the service that was provided, it was fast & courteous. I strongly recommend this restaurant to many people. If you're looking for good food, a pleasant atmosphere, along with a professional and courteous staff then you need to come to Sydnee Demar ASAP. Much Success & Prayers for this beautiful establishment...
